THE example
===========

Example Software Engineering project, taken through all typical stages of SoftEng.

The different stages of the project can be accessed through [git tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging).


Example Project Requirements
----------------------------
- Given are one or more *Raspberry Pis* with one or more sensor each;
- I (the client) want to visually see the readings from any device and sensor *online*, from anywhere;
- Poll intervals should be configurable on the Pi (how many times per minute each sensor sends data);
- A new Raspberry device can connect anytime and start sending data.
