Software Engineering Example Project: Raspberry Pi Client
---------------------------------------------------------

This client module broadcasts data to a given server.

## Launching the client

#### 1. Make sure required dependencies are satisfied

This step needs to be done only once, to make sure external dependencies are downloaded.

~~~bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

If `pip` is not available, use:

~~~bash
sudo apt-get install python-pip
~~~

#### 3. Start the client

~~~bash
python app.py
~~~
